        I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Zhejiang University of Technology, passionate about the intersection of Software Engineering and Large Language Models. I will graduate with my bachelor's degree in 2026 and am excited to pursue PhD studies at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Xin Xia](https://xin-xia.github.io/) and [Prof. Xing Hu](https://xing-hu.github.io/), focusing on applying LLM technologies to enhance software development processes and code intelligence.     
        
        During my undergraduate studies, I have gained valuable research experience in various AI domains, including medical image processing, knowledge graphs, and vision-language models. I work closely with several amazing researchers, including [Jiahe Chen](https://jiahechen2002.github.io/) (my senior colleague), and I'm always open to new collaborations and connections in the research community!

        😃 I'm always open to new collaborations and connections in the research community! 😊
